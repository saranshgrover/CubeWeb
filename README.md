# CubeWeb

CubeWeb is an experimental application that aims to get rid of scorecards at WCA Competitions. 

## Getting Started

If you want to test this project locally, clone the code and then run 
```
yarn install
yarn start
```

Note that you will need to add an additional wca-env.js with the token as 'example-application-id' and the RedirectURI as 'staging.worldcubeassociation.org' file in order for the WCA Oauth functionality to work locally with the WCA Staging server.
